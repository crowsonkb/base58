base58
======

Package base58 implements base58 encoding as used in Bitcoin addresses.

See <http://godoc.org/github.com/crowsonkb/base58>.

The base58/ subdirectory contains a command-line tool which encodes and decodes base58 data. It can also compute base58-encoded message digests using md5, sha1, sha256, or sha512.
